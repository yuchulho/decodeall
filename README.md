# 🔐 Encoding & Decoding Web Application

This is a lightweight web application that provides two main features:

1. **Automatic decoding** by detecting the encoding format of input data.
2. **Manual encoding** using a user-specified algorithm (e.g., Base64).

Whether you're analyzing encoded data or generating encoded output, this tool offers a simple and intuitive interface for both.

## ✨ Features

- Automatic detection and decoding of encoded input.
- Manual encoding using selectable algorithms.
- Real-time updates between input and output fields.
- Clean, user-friendly interface for quick testing and analysis.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the `public/index.html` file in your web browser.
2. To decode:
   - Paste encoded text into the left input field.
   - The app will detect the encoding and display the decoded result on the right.
3. To encode:
   - Enter plain text in the right input field.
   - Choose an encoding algorithm (e.g., Base64).
   - The encoded result will appear in the left input field.
